Braille Autocorrect System – Making Braille Typing Easier
App Link : https://braille-autocorrect-app-uutmdincghac9qdh9k6dw5.streamlit.app/
I created a web-based app using Streamlit that helps people type Braille using regular QWERTY keyboards. Since Braille usually requires special keyboards, I mapped common keys like D, W, Q, K, O, and P to the six Braille dots. As users type combinations (like “D K” for the letter C), the app instantly translates them into readable letters.

What makes it stand out is the built-in autocorrect system. If someone presses the wrong key or extra keys by mistake, it suggests the closest possible Braille characters based on dot patterns. It also includes features like:

* Real-time decoding as you type
* A clean split-screen layout for input and output
* Easy-to-copy results and the option to download decoded text
* Clear instructions for new users

This project taught me how to build user-friendly interfaces while solving a real accessibility challenge. It also shows how small tools, if designed well, can make a big impact.
